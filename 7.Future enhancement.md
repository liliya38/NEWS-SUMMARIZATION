# Future enhancement
Each model generates a different summarize output for the same dataset. Summarization by the BART has outperformed the GPT-2 and XLNet models.
These pre-trained models can also summarize articles, e-books, blogs with human-level performance. In the future, you can see a lot of improvements in summarization tasks. And this will help you to solve many summarization related tasks.
